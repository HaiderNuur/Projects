# Case Study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

In this case study, I will perform data analysis for a fictional bike-share company in order to help them attract more riders. 
Along the way, I will perform numerous real-world tasks of a junior data analyst by following the steps of the data analysis process: 
Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. This project works as a portfolio-ready case study to help demonstrate my knowledge and skills to potential employers!
